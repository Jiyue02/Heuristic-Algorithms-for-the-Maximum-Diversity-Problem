# Heuristic-Algorithms-for-the-Maximum-Diversity-Problem

This repository contains the implementation and analysis for the Metaheuristics course at University College Dublin, July 2023. The project focuses on solving the Maximum Diversity Problem (MDP) using the Tabu Search and GRASP metaheuristics.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop heuristic algorithms to solve the Maximum Diversity Problem (MDP). This repository provides implementations of both the Tabu Search and GRASP techniques.

## Implementation

### GRASP

The GRASP algorithm provided during the class sessions serves as the foundation for this project. The implemented GRASP can be found in `main.py`.

### Tabu Search

The Tabu Search algorithm for MDP is implemented as per the pseudocode provided and is available in `MDP_TabuSearch.py`. Different values of the tabu tenure parameter have been tested to determine the optimal performance.

## Evaluation

Empirical comparisons between the Tabu Search and GRASP algorithms are made over the 15 provided instances.
